Hi, I'm Daniel Roth!

I began programming in 2022, initially drawn in by the excitement of creating fun games to share with friends using Python and the Pygame library. The instant gratification of solving problems with code captivated me, fueling my desire to delve deeper into programming.

During my sophomore year of college, I enrolled in a computer science course that significantly enhanced my skills. Realizing that Python games were just the beginning, I expanded into web development to reach a broader audience with my projects.

Discovering Flask and Django enabled me to build robust applications for various innovative ideas. The thrill of managing every aspect of an app, from APIs to databases, was exhilarating. To further enhance user experience, I learned JavaScript and React, finding Reactâ€™s speed and DOM control particularly exciting.

This journey naturally led me to Full Stack Development, which perfectly aligns with my interests. Now, I'm dedicated to creating impactful projects and building a career in this field.
