Hi, I'm Daniel Roth!

  I started programming in 2022 when I got hooked on making fun games to share with my friends. I kicked things off with Python, thanks to the awesome Pygame library for creating 2D games. The instant feedback from solving problems with code had me hooked, and I knew I wanted to dive deeper into programming.

  While in my sophomore year of college, I enrolled in a computer science course that turbocharged my skills. Realizing that Python games were just the beginning, I decided to explore web development to share my projects with a broader audience.

  I discovered Flask and Django, which let me whip up robust applications for any wild idea I had. The thrill of managing every part of an app, from APIs to databases, was exciting. To make my web apps even more user-friendly, I picked up JavaScript and React. React's speed and control over the DOM got me excited about front-end development.

  One thing led to another, and I stumbled into the perfect fit for my interests: Full Stack Development. Now, I'm on a mission to create awesome projects and build a career doing what I love!
